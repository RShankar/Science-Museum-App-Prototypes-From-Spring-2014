##Science-Museum-App-Prototypes-From-Spring-2014
==============================================

These App prototypes integrate Apps developed in Processing and Java, and emphasize use of Android Sensors
They were develped by undergraduate engineering students during spring 2014. They used Processing and Java, with the intent to use Android sensors more effectively in the Apps. Ketai library, well documented in Sauter's book "Rapid Android Development," was used.
